# rust-game-dev-experiments

This repository contains the code for my experimenting on creating a game using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) & [Piston](https://www.piston.rs/).

## Building the code

The code uses `cargo` as a build tool and dependency manager, so you can build the code with:

```shell script
cargo build
```

## Running the experiments

After building the code you can run any experiment from the `target` directory.

Alternatively you can run:

```shell script
cargo run --bin <experiment_name>
```

to build & run the experiment in the same time.
